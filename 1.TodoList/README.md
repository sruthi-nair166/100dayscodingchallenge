### What I worked on

- Adding tasks with input validation
- Editing existing tasks using the same input and button
- Updates the task list as new tasks are added
- Showing / hiding “No tasks added” state

### What I learned

- Managing edit vs add state with flags
- Event delegation for dynamically created elements
- Sharing state between different event listeners
