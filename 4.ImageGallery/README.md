### What I worked on

- Building an interactive image gallery with dynamically rendered artwork items
- Displaying artwork details including image, title, artist, and year
- Implementing a focused image viewer with overlay and close functionality
- Adding Previous and Next navigation for browsing artworks
- Managing button disabled states at the first and last images
- Handling hover effects for gallery images without causing layout shifts

### What I learned

- Managing UI state (current image index) across multiple event handlers
- Controlling element behavior using native attributes like disabled
- Using JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM based on user interaction
- Preventing background interaction when a focused UI element is active
- Applying CSS transitions and overflow techniques for smooth hover effects
